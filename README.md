# Algo-zk - The algorand ZK Integration Library

A Python library for integrating zero-knowledge proofs with Algorand blockchain applications.

## Overview

This library provides a set of tools and abstractions for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs in Algorand applications. It enables developers to build privacy-preserving features on Algorand by leveraging the power of zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Features

- **Core ZK Proof Framework**: Abstract interfaces for provers and verifiers
- **Multiple Proof Types**:
  - Range Proofs: Prove a value is within a range without revealing it
  - Membership Proofs: Prove an element belongs to a set without revealing which one
  - Equality Proofs: Prove two commitments contain the same value
- **Algorand Integration**:
  - PyTeal bindings for on-chain verification
  - Transaction helpers for including proofs in transactions
- **Example Applications**:
  - Private Transfer: Send funds with hidden amounts
  - Confidential Voting: Vote without revealing your choice
  - Identity Verification: Prove attributes without revealing them

## About This Project

This library aims to bridge the gap between advanced cryptographic primitives and the Algorand blockchain. By providing simple abstractions over complex zero-knowledge proof systems, developers can easily incorporate privacy features into their Algorand applications without deep cryptographic expertise.

The project leverages Python's rich ecosystem of cryptographic libraries while providing seamless integration with Algorand's PyTeal and SDK. It supports various zero-knowledge proof backends while maintaining a consistent interface for developers.

This repository will contain the library's source code, examples demonstrating key use cases, and comprehensive tests to ensure reliability.
